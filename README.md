# Getting started with Ktor & Embedded Server.

Here, I get a simple message from an Netty embedded server which was configured using code parameter.
[Right here](src/main/kotlin/com/example/Application.kt) you can check how the server was configured.

In addition, some Extension functions were use to implement some new features in Application Class;
those features were written into modules which are a way to structure our Ktor App.
